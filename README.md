Foreword:

The Tides of Darkness Mod for Crusader Kings 2 is a mod that is attempting
to bring the fantastic work of Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft Universe
alive in the amazing Grand Strategy game that is Crusader Kings 2

Do note, the original version of this mod was taken from the "Lordaeron Troll Wars"
mod, after originally playing it I didn't like the cultural differences and someother
stuff so I took it and began this, Tides of Darkness that will take things from that
and then add on more to make it more lore friendly to the Warcraft Universe.
Eventually this will have a bookmark for The Second War in Warcraft history and
maybe even the Third War
